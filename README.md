# Lively-Audio-Visualizer
Audio Visualizer for lively wallpaper

![](resources/preview.gif)

# How to setup
Download the "audio visualizer.zip" file and drag and drop it into lively

If there are only a few bars showing you may need to go into settings -> sound -> Output -> Device Properties -> Additional device properties -> Advanced and change the default Format to one with a lower Hz value (the bit rate doesnâ€™t matter).

If it is displaying nothing please write an issue or a comment on reddit.

# Additional
The livelyAudioListener function by lively is still in progress so it should improve over time.
The feature for displaying the currently playing song is not jet implemented but it should come in a future update. So the color picker "audio track text color" has no purpose right now.

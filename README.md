# Lively-Audio-Visualizer
Audio Visualizer for lively wallpaper

# How to setup
Download the "audio visualizer.zip" file and drag and drop it into lively

If there are only a few bars showing you may need to go into settings -> sound -> Output -> Device Properties -> Additional device properties -> Advanced and chnage the default Format to one with a lower Hz rate (the bit rate doesen't matter).

# Additional
The livelyAudioListener function by lively is still in progress so it should improve over time. Also the is a function which provids the currently plaing track, but for some reason I didn't get it to work, but it is implemented in the code. This could be on my end, or on livelys end, if it is on livelys end then the Audio Visualizer should start displaing the currently playing song. If the problem is on my end I would very welcome of you could tell me what I did wrong.
